Billa.... My Name Is Billa...... Everything in life My name is billa.... I am not a person who has not seen all my life, i am not a place that does not go, if i am not a good friend, i will not let you go anywhere, i will not touch myself ayya oho... ................. Hey who doesn't belong to who doesn't believe in friendship no speeds vedas even needs run by rest It is between life and death that the path I take is right or wrong, whoever wants what we want. My name is billa.... I am not a person who has not seen all my life, i am not a place that does not go, if i am not a good friend, i will not let you go anywhere, i will not touch myself ayya oho... They came and went yesterday no one has a trace, today you are what I am, what am I in a relationship, happiness in a relationship, if there are distances between mind and knowledge, only good is that there is no place for anyone within me, that is the truth. My name is billa.... I am not a person who has not seen all my life, i am not a place that does not go, if i am not a good friend, i will not let you go anywhere, i will not touch myself ayya oho... ..................
