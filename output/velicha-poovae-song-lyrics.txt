Anirudh Ravichander { Oh ho... On the day of the power cut, you came here like electricity, come on, my light flower come on } (2) Come on, come on, come in the sun that removes the cold, come on, love, when the rain cloud comes, I called the peacock tokai viriyato come, darling. { Love is a zorum of time when it comes to the story of Adam and Eve that began with the story of the story } (2) When did you wake up to Japan and walk, haikuwei, whose hands and legs sprouted Haiku and unakor kai poove that sprinkles jawadhu's mind on you The pigeons will get into the skin so that the ceremonies that do not break up every day Let go of all the tingling of the touch of the flower, the touch of the flower, the tingling, the longing, the yearning, the youth, the youth, the youth, the young man. { Oh ho... On the day of the power cut, you came here like electricity, come on, my light flower come on } (2) Come on, come on, come in the sun that removes the cold, come on, love, when the rain cloud comes, I called the peacock tokai viriyato come, darling. { Love is a zorum of time when it comes to the story of Adam and Eve that began with the story of the story } (2)
