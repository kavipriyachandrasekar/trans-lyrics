I'm finished with you in my heart I've finished you in the chest. In the direction in which the dawn of the dawn you've thrown a white glance, you've thrown a glass of water that can't stand it before. Color maniyaram right-hand kediyaram anai tiger-suppressing power Even after you're gone, the shadow doesn't just go, the shadow has fallen into the chest cavity. Then nimindava thaan thenama kuniyalaiye kuniyalaiye kuniyalaiye kodakkampi like a heart piercing nikkuthe I'm finished with you in my heart I'm finished with you in my heart. Pachi is asleep, the milk curd is asleep, even the elai is sleeping on the tree. When tuberculosis patients are also awake, they don't sleep for half a minute when they get sick. Hey... Hey... Hey... I'm finished with you in my heart. A mouth is not wet, the inner tongue is wet, seven or eight days of saliva is not swallowed. Hey young girl can't say something, you don't have a mouth to shout at all the rubber. O thou art finished in thy heart, and in the direction in which the dawn of the dawn thou hast cast a white gaze, thou hast cast a glass of water in the mind which could not bear it before. Color maniyaram right-hand kediyaram anai tiger-suppressing power Even after you're gone, the shadow doesn't just go, the shadow has fallen into the chest cavity. Then nimindava thaan thenama kuniyalaiye kuniyalaiye kuniyalaiye kodakkampi like a heart piercing nikkuthe I'm finished with you in my heart I'm finished with you in my heart.
