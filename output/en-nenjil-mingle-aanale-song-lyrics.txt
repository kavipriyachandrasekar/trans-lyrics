Just like Twinkle Star, life has become full for me, just like Twinkle Star in my heart. The mental ventilator is open, the worry smokes and the double is here single aayache She did a scanning and said a meaning to the flower of my heart by her memory, love is for my life. ........................... ........................... I'll go up to that moon stage and sing, the stars just wink and clap my hands The flower clouds that put the rainbow and the seven welcome nets for me are the joys I sing Mugil's thunder, light, explosion string, lightning, lightning, photo, the joy of life, the sky and the earth are here. ........................... ........................... The mind sings and sings only when it hears a matter, the body will sway like a ball on the wave When life is caught in the eye of the little spear, it tells you to see anything upside down. I was alone in one way and now I will fly as a jet on the runway, dear, who lives together all the time and in love. ........................... Just like Twinkle Star, life has become full for me, just like Twinkle Star in my heart. ........................... The mental ventilator is open, the worry smokes and the double is here single aayache ........................... She did a scanning and told me that by her memory my heart flower was a meaning of the flower, she said love is for my life. ...........................
