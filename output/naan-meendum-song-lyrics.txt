I want to be myself again help the girl melt the body turns into fire If I say here, scratching the clothes at a boundary and putting the sensation at two points and shying away I'm ashamed i'm here because of you Leave the trace of your coming and going in my hands aaaaaaaaa...... Aaaaaaaaaaa Keep within me the mystery that you have lost in you aaaaa...... Aaaaaaaa..... Make me a forest, make me a prison, make me god, make me god, four legs a journey in the night, the highest pleasures of the lakshadwere the trace behind the door of heaven I take the key. Oh, if the whole body is a lie, then happiness is real, if only the world is real, are you and me a liar? You know someone who knows who knows the shadow knows the other reality knows nothing is real here. The couch inside is not a lie here, if the lie is mixed with the truth, then it is called man.
