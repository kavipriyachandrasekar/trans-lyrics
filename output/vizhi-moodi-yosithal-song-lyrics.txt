If you close your eyes and think about it, you have come there. { If you close your eyes and think, you have come there too. You have the pleasure of talking alone, girl, woman. Will the rainy season come into my life like this? Rain parrot, rain parrot, I have seen your eye Through the eye I have seen myself through the eye } (2) All the words that speak like the sea will be reduced to droplets Only languages that speak silence Both the legs of the self will walk in the direction of the untan Distance, time, time, everything will shrink If this love comes, our body will float and play with the sky and the cloud. Oh oh. If you close your eyes and think about it, you have come there. You have the pleasure of talking alone, girl, woman. Will the rainy season come into my life like this? { Rain parrot, rain parrot, I have seen your eye I have seen myself through the eye through the eye } (2) Senthene ............................... It is the pin in the bait of desire that pulls the heart like a fish, and after being caught, the mind is throbbing to get caught again. If the revolving earth leaves me and stands flying around alone, there is something new in my heart. Isn't this a magic net, isn't it a new infatuation, a weight that changes my clothes, a change of style, likes me. If you close your eyes and think about it, you have come there. You have the pleasure of talking alone, girl, woman. Will the rainy season come into my life like this? .............................
