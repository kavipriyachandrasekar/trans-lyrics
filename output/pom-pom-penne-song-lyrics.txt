The music that strikes the heart is the lyrics of the nilladi unakkai or the song that I have not heard. Let's join hands and remove the bitterness and put it in the air. Bam Bam Baam Girl, false angry woman, if you punish him, he will take his life. Baam Bam Bam Girl, False Angry Girl, If you forgive him, he will finish his song. What else is there to beg for any one who has gone in search of something else? You also ask this question to anyone who is looking for you to drink honey who is researching on the smell of the beetle leaping away from the flower Like a bad cat, if you tell me to put your tail on the goat for milk, I will learn with some difficulty. Bam Bam Baam Girl, false angry woman, if you punish him, he will take his life. Baam Bam Bam Girl, False Angry Girl, If you forgive him, he will finish his song. She is the one who understands the position of the lover who realizes the mistake she has committed, who is superior to the God. The smell of yesterday is again in the air, the song of yesterday, or again in the ear there is a garland of gold in the ear, and all thoughts bloom again. Bam Bam Bam You and Bam Bam Bam Bam I Have Come Together The Flower Drizzle Is On Top Of Us Bam Bam Bam Bam You and Bam Bam Bam I have joined hands and have not parted anymore
