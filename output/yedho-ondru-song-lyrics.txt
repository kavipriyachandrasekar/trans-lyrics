Something to attack me like someone to look at you like someone and walk the drama anywhere around the girl how to act I slept with the dream of living all the time in my eyes, longing to hold in my hand the moon that dawned in the morning. Girl, I have put the memory of Unthan in my heart, i have lost my heart here when I am leaving you. I am leaving myself to you. There is nothing. Where to go with me, to ask whom, all the way is with you. Why did you come into my life, you changed my night and day, why did you give me this separation, you poured loneliness into my heart? I heard your voice inside and i forgot where i was walking where i was beating my life. Girl, I have put the memory of Unthan in my heart, i have lost my heart here when I am leaving you.
