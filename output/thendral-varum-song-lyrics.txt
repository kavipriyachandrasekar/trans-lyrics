Illayaraja The flowers don't know the way the breeze comes, i don't understand the heart of the flower to the breeze, i wrote down my mind, i raised the first poem in the eye, i hugged the dream i hugged the pillow, don't rob the pillow. The way that the breeze comes is nanana na na lala lala lala lala lala laa thendral malarin nana na lala lala lala lala lala laa laa Neeya ada naanaa nana who lost the heart for the first time naana nana nana naana naana naa Who was the first to jump into the river of love here? I have seen you in me and who is dividing us into two? The body is in which the living entity is separated from the one who is the nana naana naana naana Suffering The suffering you give, too, must continue forever the longing in the heart that longs for pleasure.

The way that the breeze comes is nanana na na lala lala lala lala lala laa thendral malarin nana na lala lala lala lala lala laa laa ................................. Love is your love and it comes as rain. My heart is soaked in it, my heart is soaked in it. The sky is my sky is coming from a rainbow. Silence My silence wanders for a word.
