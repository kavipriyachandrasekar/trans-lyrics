A. R. Rahman ....................................... Dear love, don't kill, dear, don't pinch the eye, girl, don't burst your heart with a smile Alas, don't drink your life in your voice. Don't kill dear dear don't pinch the eye. Girl, I saw your melody, Ada Brahma Kanchanadi, I straightened up a little, I went around my head, Ah, he took hold of the lightning, cooked the brush and made a 100-foot marble by Ravivarman and the sculptors carved a six-foot edifice of 100 feet marble. The flower that you gave, the flower, the smell of her hair, the river that you gave, the river she gave, the river she bathed, the beauty of the feet, the size of the feet, the size of the feet, the bell that you gave, the beauty of the mar. ....................................... I will fill the beautiful moon with oxygen and make a house for you there, and i will give you life with my life to save your life. ....................................... I'll grab the cloud and make mattresses and make you sleep with a thin flower, I'll wipe you with a star when you're rooting in the marp in your sleep, I'll collect all the dewdrops for a bath of the milk-colored bird, I'll take the drops of the angel bathed and drink it as a theertham. Don't kill dear love don't kill dear don't kill darling don't pinch the eye .......................................
