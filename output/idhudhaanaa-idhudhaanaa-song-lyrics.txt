hmmmm aaaaa Is this this the day of the opposite, is this the man who is the bridegroom? Even during the day, the dreams that I have seen come true to you, I am yours, i am yours, the wedding day, the day of the wedding, my days are a burden of happiness. I will sing a song for myself without raising my voice without plucking the petals. Is this this the day of the opposite, is this the man who is the bridegroom? From now on, the drama that takes place every day at home will be hidden and your eyes will wander in search of me. You will find me in the bend of the stairs, pretend to be as if you don't see me, you will suddenly turn around and hug me at the bottom of the stairs in my loins, and you will hide your fears and fear, and you will hide in shame. Is this this the day of the opposite, is this the man who is the bridegroom? On Sunday afternoons you will cook, you will have fun, you will wash your clothes, everyone in the town will see you, you will be a child in the house, my face will still glow with pride, my face will still glow in pride, my mind will be filled with joy, my height will grow a little more. ....................................... This is the bridegroom who wears the flower, the dreams I have seen during the day come true, I am yours, i am yours, the wedding day is counted, my days are a burden of happiness. I will sing a song for myself without raising my voice without plucking the petals.
