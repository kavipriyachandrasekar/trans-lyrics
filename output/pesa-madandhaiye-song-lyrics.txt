Bessa madanthaiye eye speaking picture saree baby is my pet riot I plucked the flower of the heart, i stroked the string with the vein, i gave it to my hand, my dear, you trampled on the feet, girl. Bessa madanthaiye eye speaking picture saree baby is my pet riot Before counting the seven colors, the rainbow dissolved will reappear in the middle of the way? Life is over before the woman's state of mind is cleared, the sky trembles in confusion and faints You're afraid of the blame for black, you've plucked flowers for the puja, you're trembling like the murder of the flowers. I fell in love with words, you killed me with the jars, i heard only the rain, girl, i gave you thunder and lightning, my dear. The picture of the eye speaking is the picture of the eye The fire in the bamboo forest is also beautiful, but I don't enjoy it, alas the heart doesn't tolerate it. You're beautiful when anger sinks, but I don't enjoy it, Sakhi, my mind can't bear it. Seeing your anger, my heart beats out of my body, and your mind is broken in two. If the seed breaks, the plant sprouts, if the mind is broken, the grass sprouts, the punishment is simple, and your silence is even more deadly than the bucket.
