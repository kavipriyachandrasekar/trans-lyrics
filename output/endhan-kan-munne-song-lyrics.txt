Ohooooo naa nan naa oho ooooo naa nan naa I have disappeared before my eyes, i have become a star that no one has seen in vain. { I heard the sound of my heart breaking, was this what I was expecting} (2) I hear the rain, you burn me, you hear the light, you look at the eyes. Will you allow the dream to continue, will you let the dream go to sleep if you give me the pains and pains? Hmmm mm mmmm mm aaaahmmm
