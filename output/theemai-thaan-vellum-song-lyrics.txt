There is only a desire to do good for the good, the bad one has the greed to do bad, it is greed for me, it is greed that wins the battle between desire and greed. Evil will win, no matter what he thinks evil will win, no matter who prevents it. { I am a wandering beast in the form of man and i am a god to the beasts of man } (2) He who is in the light will be afraid of the darkness. I live in the dark I'm not bad just evil If there is anyone, whatever is Yama, whatever is Shiva, I will be equal to you. If it's money, what if it's a corpse, what if I'm alive, I'll eat anyone as food when I'm alive. { I am a wandering beast in the form of man and i am a god to the beasts of man } (2) The truth wins requires tanda proof and confusion is enough to win a lie. If it is a suthai, whatever it is, if it is tita, whatever it is, it will be good for me. The earth will conquer it and go up to the abyss and rule entha in a grand manner. Evil will win, no matter what he thinks evil will win, no matter who prevents it. ...........................
