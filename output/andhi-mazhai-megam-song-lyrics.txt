D. L. Mahalingam, P.; Susheela and team Illayaraja The day when the twilight rain clouds the golden rain pours down, the day when we sing that the time has come for us too. Hoi Idi Kottu Melam It's time to pour down our street with the chariot and the chariot on the day of the day. The day when the twilight rain clouds the golden rain pours down, the day when we sing that the time has come for us too. The path on which the water walks is poisonous everywhere is its own theme The theme of the famine everywhere on the path we walk Who did the niches and art galleries did it we did it we gave it to a kingdom of the country who gave it to us Roots in the oasis of the nation We ourselves are the lamp in the light of sacrifice. Taamtanathom Dheemthanathom Raagam Let's Sing The day when the twilight rain clouds the golden rain pours down, the day when we sing that the time has come for us too. Hey idi kottu melam it's time to pour in our street with the chariot and the chariot and the day is the day of the day. Ho.. Oops.. Oops.. Whoa... Ho.. Oops.. Oops.. Whoa... Milk pots honey pots came a hundred theme A deity who worships the hand came in person with the theme Put poovaram no more, add camphor no more, what are the kali games all over the town, show it now. There was joy in my heart when I saw the mangalam coming from house to house today. Taamtanathom Dheemthanathom Raagam Let's Sing The day when the twilight rain clouds the golden rain pours down, the day when we sing that the time has come for us too. Hey idi kottu melam it's time to pour male and all over our street with the chariot and the chariot and the day is the day of the day. The day when the twilight rain clouds the golden rain pours down, the day when we sing that the time has come for us too.
