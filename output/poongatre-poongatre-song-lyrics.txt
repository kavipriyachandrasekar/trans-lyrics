She came like a flower in the park, and she was happy the way she went. The affection of this woman blowing with my heart will speak to the many stars that bloom in her eyes. I don't have a word to say my love there's no longer a dream in my eyes She came like a flower in the park, and she was happy the way she went. The yellow sky is a little cloudy, the wind that speaks a little cloudy, i'm not stopping to touch it, i'm laughing all these minutes. I look into the back of your eyes with a glass saree, I look at it, girl, I am losing a word in front of you without saying a word, I am defeating. Even if the passerby goes by, you will remember this moment with the scent of life where there is a footprint on the way. She came like a flower in the park, and she was happy the way she went. If she sees a beautiful river, she is tempted to hear its name, and she is a stupor until she knows what someone is. I'm going beyond some town, i'm going through a lot of people, i'm going, i'm going, i'm going to turn off as a highway lamp that says stop. In the language and in the song, the meanings of the song are also circulating today, and the distance that you have come and gone as a companion is reduced. The affection of this woman blowing with my heart will speak to the many stars that bloom in her eyes. I don't have a word to say my love there's no longer a dream in my eyes She came like a flower in the park, and she was happy the way she went.
