If you don't, there is no life rainbow, look at your face and wake up Oh love, but it doesn't hurt that fate, and the sword won't kill me like that word. If you don't, there is no life rainbow, look at your face and wake up O love, though, is not evil, and the sword will not kill me like that word. If you don't have the rainbow in life ....................................... Write a hundred songs in the middle of the night when the light dances in the small poothiri without a book or a letter. My silence will tell you that your heart will chew it chewing on it, chewing on it, the middle of the earth it will go and the sky will kill us. Your desire is not evil, it will never guard the feet. If you don't, there is no life rainbow, look at your face and wake up Dear dear, what if you accept me as your dress today? I have painted many paintings with my hands of the city, and i have painted your picture with my eyes, dear lover. Even Husain has not painted a painting like you here, and if he sees you, his body will be blowing like rain. When this love comes, even that Harichandran will tell many lies. If you don't, there is no life rainbow, look at your face and wake up O love, though, is not evil, and the sword will not kill me like that word. Dear dear, what if you accept me as your dress today?
