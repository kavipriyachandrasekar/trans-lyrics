A drop of rain comes as a drop of rain, shoots, hides, disappears, looks at the name of the bird, appears to hear the name of the flower, and when you laugh, the wind appears to fly. Go, go to her, go to her, tell her legs, tell her, tell her heart, she's beautifully taken away her mind. A drop of rain has come as a drop of rain.... Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, go away.... The angel she is an angel beautiful flower face life is enough to see the face of her, her scent in the air is enough to ask her for advice, the flowers bloom, the single hair dances above the forehead, the light blooms in the chest, the cheek that lifts the man, the cheeks that touch it with kisses, and the foot appears to turn into a golu when you look at both the feet. Beautifully, she has snatched away the mind, go to her, go to her, tell her legs, tell her, tell her, she has taken away her heart beautifully. I long to go with her on a beautiful evening on the road, lean on my shoulders, run away and carry the shadow when i fall to the earth, i will bear it in my chest, i will tie me up with my eyes when i see it, she cut me off unharmed, she did something with her life, she came there silently and listened to her, and she cried out in her dream. Beautifully, she has taken away the mind, go to her, go to her, tell her. { A drop of rain came as a drop of rain, and he disappeared to shoot to shoot} (2)
