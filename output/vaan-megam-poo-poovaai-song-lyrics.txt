The sky cloud will bloom, the flower, the flower, what will happen to the body and the body will look happy The raindrop splashed within me, the bath within me, the thought, the umbrella sprouted. The sky said, The pearls, the sindhi, live, the love won, the clouds came, the flowers shed, the man, the man, the thread to gather, the thread to join together. The sky cloud will bloom, the flower, the flower, what will happen to the body and the body will look happy In the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, in the sky, what are the reasons why my mind is overflowing? When his eyes moved, her mind moved, or the flower flag quivered as she caught the shoots. All over the road, there is a musical platform, or a dress, or a dance, or a tokai aadu, or a poet all over the earth, and a jalatarangam where saral sings. The sky cloud will bloom, the flower, the flower, what will happen to the body and the body will look happy The raindrop splashed within me, the bath within me, the thought, the umbrella sprouted. The sky said, The pearls, the sindhi, live, the love won, the clouds came, the flowers shed, the man, the man, the thread to gather, the thread to join together. The sky cloud will bloom, the flower, the flower, what will happen to the body and the body will look happy
