Santhosh Narayanan All the heart is colored and many colours, all the eyes are full of pleasure and become tears. Until I saw you, the nations were alone. A thousand million times I died every day, I killed myself in the division {The river of maya today is the way of marriage, and love blossoms in pure grey} (2) I lost my relationship like fish through the water, and I attained a renunciation between you and you. Does the darkness of light become the object of life and give you a longing as the pain that heals the pain... The river of maya today flows through the marbil and the love blossoms in pure grey The strength of the elephant will come here and life will return the way it went in the relationship. I reached an army that ruled over the whole land, and I lost my flag to the warrior of time. Come, come, fall on your lap like the rain of the sand, come on, come on, fall on the dam, fall down and cry. The river of maya today flows through the marbil and the love blossoms in pure grey The strength of the elephant will come here and life will return the way it went in the relationship.
