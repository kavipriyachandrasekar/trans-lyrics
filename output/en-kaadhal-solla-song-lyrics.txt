I don't have time to tell my love no need to tell your love don't have to tell us our love doesn't want to hide the truth.... I don't long to get into your hand, i don't want to lie on your shoulder, i don't want to lie that there's no sadness after you're gone. Because of your beauty, because of your beauty, it is my summer, it is the rainy season, it is your dream, your dream, the mind wanders, and slowly the umbrella will die. I don't have time to tell my love no need to tell your love don't have to tell us our love doesn't want to hide the truth..... If you speak with your hand to the wind, the storm will blow with your heart, some thoughts will blow without telling you with age and mind. If love comes with the eye, then the counterfeiting will come with the eyes, i will get drunk, i will act a little bit, i will be a little throbbing, i will enjoy this game. With your eyes, your eyes will change my way, my eye will stumble, this is some new longing, and even if it hurts, the heart will accept it. Let these intimacies continue without saying a word, just shut your eyes without thinking of anything else, only for minutes to pass. I look at you without anyone looking at me, i see you without knowing me, i see you as a little child, my eyelids jump when it sees you. My early in the morning my early morning should look at your face and wake up every day, my dusk evening, my dusk evening, my twilight evening, i will lean on your lap and fall every day ...... I don't have time to tell my love no need to tell your love don't have to tell us our love doesn't want to hide the truth.... I don't long to get into your hand, i don't want to lie on your shoulder, i don't want to lie that there's no sadness after you're gone.
