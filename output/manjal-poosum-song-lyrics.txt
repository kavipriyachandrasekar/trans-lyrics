Illayaraja I touched the yellow-coated sky, i heard the talk of the dhoti, i saw the saree-clad cloud, i heard a garland of shola flowers. New waves beat in the mind, goldfish in the eyes, goldfish in the eyes, love come, let her shame down. I touched the yellow-coated sky, i heard the talk of the dhoti, i saw the saree-clad cloud, i heard a garland of shola flowers. There is a door to make kolam and the house is without the door Ho Undan's heart is like a temple and that's why I gave the lamp. A life that lives within sight of the eyes is enough Heavy clouds touch the soil with water Unthan love goes back a way back to kanmani I touched the yellow-coated sky, i heard the talk of the dhoti, i saw the saree-clad cloud, i heard a garland of shola flowers. The breeze came and opened the window and love entered through the window The wind stopped to enter the ho love and the window closed the door Closing eyes don't always see the wind The colors that appear in the dream do not become real. The word that tells me my way back is the good way. I touched the yellow-coated sky, i heard the talk of the dhoti, i saw the saree-clad cloud, i heard a garland of shola flowers.
