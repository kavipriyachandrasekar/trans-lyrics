A. R. Rahman ................................. The herd of fruits hidden within the flower is a miracle........................... Paintings on the body of butterflies are a miracle........................... The miracle of the perforating air becoming melodious........................... A cuckoo song without a guru is a miracle........................... The wonder will be amazed, you are the wonder of love, the wonder of love before the stone appears and the earth appears, o ho O ho is the love wonder that spreads to everyone during the age of sixteen The herd of fruits hidden within the flower is a miracle...........................

On top of a smellless branch, there is not the slightest drop of salt in the cloud given by the waves, and the rain water is a miracle.

Thou art my wonder, the seven wonders in the world, the flower that speaks the mouth, the eighth wonder, the sky, thy eyes, thy eyes, thy honey-splashing cheeks, the milk-drinking madaras, the wonder. The fingers with the nagging are a miracle, the crown of the nail is a miracle, the moving curves are a miracle. O ho is the miracle of love that occurred before the stone-shaped earth appears and the sea appears A love miracle that spreads to everyone at the age of sixteen The herd of fruits hidden within the flower is a miracle........................... Paintings on the body of butterflies are a miracle........................... The miracle of the perforating air becoming melodious........................... A cuckoo song without a guru is a miracle........................... The wonder will amaze you, what wonder are you? ................................. .................................
