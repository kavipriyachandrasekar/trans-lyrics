Santhosh Narayanan Aaaaa The bait fish sleeps and the flower smells bad. By looking with the eye, the seed or the flowering plant fills the pool of life in a drop of rain. On a one-way trip, the dawn is visible. I saw the sky and saw the beautiful star melting the heart of the distant rock like mine. I floated on the sea as a boat looking for the shore and drank all the sea to reach the shore. I mixed my hair with your body and melted into wax to see your beautiful face. Aaaaaaaaaaa I saw the sky and saw the beautiful star melting the heart of the distant rock like mine. I wandered in search of a lap like a land looking for seed and invited me to drink on my lap. I have disappeared into you like the moon in the daytime, i have become the day in the night, when the full moon comes. Aaaaaaaaaaa Time to hold the distant moon on the shoulder is lost in the eye of sleep.
