Harris Jayaraj ........................................... Oh... Aaye aaye aaye aaye aayi aayi thuvum poomazhai in the chest o... The smell is the breath, the smell comes and the smell is in me. You are a dream that enters the chest and wanders in your breath and blossoms in your eyes. You're the moon that bends in my hand and floats over me and walks on the road {Are you and you the feet, the blue-blue fire, the fire, the fire, the fire, the one who is the one who makes me fall into the fire}} (2) ........................................... Oh... Aaye aaye aaye aaye aayi aayi thuvum poomazhai in the chest o... The smell is the breath, the smell comes and the smell is in me. The dream of entering the chest and wandering in the breath and dying in the eye, you are the memory of you bending in my hand and floating over me and walking in the evening. ........................................... ........................................... The beauty that carries the elixir in one eye and madhuram in the other eye in the other eye. The sweet one who gives me the claws in one hand and the pleasures in the other in the other hand. If the petal is a flower, where is the honey in it, here the flower is the honey honey honey honey honey ........................................... Oh... Aaye aaye aaye aaye aayi aayi thuvum poomazhai in the chest o... The smell is the breath, the smell comes and the smell is in me. The dream of entering the chest and wandering in the breath and dying in the eye, you are the memory of you bending in my hand and floating over me and walking in the evening. ........................................... ........................................... I have seen you and enjoyed seeing you, even with eyes that do not blink, praying for me for me. When the first kiss was given and the first kiss was given, the magazine was burned in total, and i counted it and counted it. Don't shoot in the shooting park, don't shoot anymore vaniye raincharal poovai Oh... Aaye aaye aaye aaye aayi aayi thuvum poomazhai in the chest Ho Ho Ho Oh... The smell is the breath, the smell comes and the smell is in me. Ho Ho Ho You are a dream that enters the chest and wanders in your breath and blossoms in your eyes. You're the memory of walking in the evening, bending in my hand and floating on top of me. Ho ho ho..... Are you and you the feet are you the blue-blue fire, are you and you the feet?
