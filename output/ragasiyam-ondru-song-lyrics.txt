Harish Jeyaraj He told me a secret, my heart stopped for a moment that love had come to an end, and today How did it come to be the habit of talking to myself, and i too would see his cold face. There is no season in the eye, there is no sorrow, happiness, happiness, what happens if you carry love, woman, the sleep that entered into you, the murderer, the sleep is lost. He told me a secret, my heart stopped for a moment that love had come to an end, and today I became beautiful, I lived in a dream, i was immersed in myself, i was looking for myself If her breath mixed in the air only touched me, and if she goes away, give me a broken heart with tears in her eyes. If you see in the eye, there is no sorrow, happiness, happiness, what will happen if you carry love, what will happen if you are carrying love, the woman who is in you, the sleep of the woman who has entered you, the murderer, the girl, the girl, the lost sleep.
