I ran like a river and searched for the sea every day, whether the pain of loneliness would not be quenched, or that I would live after the wind was gone. The incurable wound will not heal from you in the mind The sky is the star i'm used to seeing, and the rock's heart melts somewhere Somehow today, if she goes farther, it was like the music of the heart beating on the left, wherever she went. I am asking you to sleep without two eyelids, I ask for the rain to fall asleep without a blink of an eye, i sing to the earth, i am looking for a shadow without you. The sky is the star i'm used to seeing, and the rock's heart melts somewhere I looked everywhere unthan image in dreams and memories, day after day, and she who comes every day, will not come again in any other place. I ran like a river and searched for the sea every day, the pain of loneliness would not be quenched, the fish caught in the thorn in the bait, the time when I would be deceived, no longer venamadi kai cheradi The sky is the star i'm used to seeing, and the rock's heart melts somewhere
