Harris Jayaraj {Round eye flame, round eye flame, my world revolves around you, touch your picture in the pocket of your shirt, touch it and rub it on my heart, i fell into your eye, i flew in space, i woke up, i saw the dream i woke up because of you, i saw the dream } (2) I saw it in the middle of the eye, I saw it in the eye, I said, I am not looking for the middle. I grumbled in my sleep, i stood in the distance, i remembered you if i sneezed Do you have black and white flowers, I saw in your eyes, your eyes will call them beetle-eating flowers, your eyes will say, 'Flowers that eat beetles'. My world revolves around you, touch your picture in your pocket, touch it, touch it, touch my heart, fall into your eye, fly in space, i wake up, i see the dream, i wake up because of you, i see the dream. A bird with a tree has been blown away and today I have given it from body to life. Today, I have also discovered that without fire, there is no fire, and there is no fire, and there is no body. The rain is beautiful, the sun is beautiful when the sun is beautiful, the rain is beautiful kanna if you are angry, the sun is beautiful if you are angry, the sun is beautiful. Round eye flame, round eye flame, my world revolves around you, touch your picture in the pocket of your shirt and touch it and kill my heart I fell into your eyes, I flew in space, I woke up, I saw the dream, I woke up because of you, I saw the dream.
