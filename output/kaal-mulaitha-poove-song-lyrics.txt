Madan Karky ..................... Come and dance with me, come on, the flower with which the foot has sprouted! Come and sing love like the Volga river! The smell of the flower in the game, I saw it on your lips! I saw soviet paintings at the edge of your eyes! Kneading the mind in a moving movement Hey hey hey to pour rain on the heart's cleft hey hey rubbing life to wake up the heat hey hey burning frenzy splashed.... Come on, come on, come, sing love with me, come on, come on, like the volga river. The moons bowed their heads, the flowers were destroyed, the duty of God was fulfilled, the moment you were born, beautiful! Are the heads bent? Is mamatha destroyed? Is the duty over? The moment you are born! Hey girl.....2 I feel like I'm lost in your curves. I'm struggling in between. I'll ask. Lala Lala Lala..... Come on, come to dance with me, come sing love with me, come on, come on, like the volga river. When the moon burns at night, your fingers wander like threads! As you get closer, the discipline melts! When the moon burns, do the fingers move? Does discipline melt as we get closer? Somehow... ....2 Melt me, you lower the fire into your chest, you shrink the gap without mercy... You're tightening up! .................. Come and dance with me, come on, the flower with which the foot has sprouted! Come and sing love like the Volga river! The smell of the flower in the game, I saw it on your lips! I saw Soviet painting poems at the edge of your eyes. {Kneading the mind in the moving movement mmm pouring rain on the heart's cleft, mmm rubbing life and stirring up the heat mmm mmm throbbing with a burning frenzy. ..} (2)
