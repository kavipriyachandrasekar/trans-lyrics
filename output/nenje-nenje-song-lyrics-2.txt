Harris Jayaraj ................................... Where are you, where am I and my life there, where is my life, where am I, dear, where am I, where am my body here? My god, you have dried up in front of my eyes, you have come to the ground in search of me as a sky, why are you in the sky when my thirst is not quenched? Oh nenje nenje where are you and where i am and my life is there My dear, my dear, if I do not see you, the sky and this land are false. Dear grandson, if I did not reach you, i have accepted the spirit of my spirit and i have accepted It is only when the summer season comes that the water becomes honey and it is only when you have a cup of water that tastes good in the ear. The distance of your life, the life of my life, the time when your breath is stretched, my body is warm. Where are you, where am I and my life there, where is my life, where am I, dear, where am I, where am my body here? Kalva hey kalva, if you don't listen to me, don't listen to me and my heart. Don't let it go away in the ear, don't let the wind leave our earth. If the sky changes place, let it go, but you should not change your mind. Hey manjal thaamaraiye my supreme thara kaiye kadal mannai go, don't change our ears Nenje Nenje Nenje Where are you and where I am and my life is there Dear dear, where am I here and my life here? My god, you have dried up in front of my eyes, you have come in search of me like a sky, you have come to the ground in search of me, why are you coming to the rain without quenching your thirst? .....................................
