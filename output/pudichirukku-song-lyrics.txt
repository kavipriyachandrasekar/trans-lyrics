Harris Jayaraj ...................................... Ayyo ayyo, you've me, you've me, i've you too. You have the courage, your pulse is very sweet, you have the innocence, you have the desire to steal me. I don't know how to steal a new thief and steal completely Ayyo ayyo, you've me, you've me, i've you too. ...................................... Valluvan's kuralai has a two-bucket lip-smacking lip The drama of the lips near the love lobe Your madisarai folds are swollen and you have drunkenness in them. Alas, because you come in a dream every day, you have fallen asleep. Ayyyo ayyo ayy You've me What's the matter I've loved you too. ......................................

Even Kattabomman will pluck flowers in the battlefield if he falls in love I made you study love lessons today, studying in the morning and evening. I have turned you from a watchman into a thief today. Oops, damn, you've me, you've me, i've got you too. You have the courage, your pulse is very sweet, you have the innocence, you have the desire to steal me. The newly stolen thief is completely in love with me ...................................
