Can the fire da get closer da can you be afraid haha haa Can the thought of destroying the fire come near the crowd of fires? You're a submissive person, you're the one who's pulled it up, you're the one who respects all the obstacles, you're the one who wants to be in the morning Kabali... Kabali joy There will be a tension in the heart to reap the compassion, the worries, the patience, all the magic here, the magic, your heroism, and our nation, which will be raging, will see a new change even if there is a raging rage all over our country. Tell me I'm here... I have come back... Tell me that you have come back the way you went 25 years ago... Kabali daa... Break the daydream once in a time of fear of thinking that liberation is the answer Heroism, sacrifice, fight, fight, wound on your shoulder, heal and heal No longer hostility treachery magic magic magic the future is no longer epic Kabali.... Kabali.... Kabali
