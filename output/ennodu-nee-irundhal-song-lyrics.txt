A. R. Rahman No forests that give air, no seas that give me water, no earth to eat, no earth to eat, no need for anything, all that is needed is an angel. {If you are with me, I will be alive, and if you are with me, I will be alive} (3) No one knows who I am, no one knows who I am. No one knows that you are my love. If you ask, I will buy the world, and I will not live in a world without you. If you are with me. If true love is, I will tell you to me, if you and I are lying, I will seek love and kill you, i will put my hair and moustache together in the needle thread, and i will keep it in my chest like water in a coconut. Rose flower in vatikuchi camp If the cat asks for honey will the flowers accept the flowers will it bloom in the crocodile pond I was afraid of the monkey near the child If you are with me, I will be alive, and if you are with me, I will be alive. If I were alive I would be alive and I would be alive {If you are with me, I will be alive, and if you are with me, I will be alive} (2) I wouldn't live in a world without you if you were with me.
