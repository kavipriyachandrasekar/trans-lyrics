I developed some thought, I gave myself into your hand, you are the king of smiles, you are the king of smiles, you are your queen, I am the cultured singer, you are your raga. I developed a thought for something For some time I have been living in prison, I live by myself because I have seen you I sleep, I wake up, I grow flowers Some flowers bloom on their own, many flowers fall somehow the answer is what is the component of the flower and I am different. I developed a thought for something O family deity, i stretched out my hand to solve my grievances, do you bring me to the shore, you put out the fire, come to put out the fire, when you see me, I will be busy when you see it, I will lean on your chest and cool down. I developed some thought, I gave myself into your hand, you are the king of smiles, you are the king of smiles, you are your queen, I am the cultured singer, you are your raga. I developed some thought and gave myself into your hand.
