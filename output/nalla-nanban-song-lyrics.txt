Does that death think you want a good friend, or does it want to take you away because you are the best? God, God, do you want his life, take our life, is it enough for you? This is our rose plant that is eating it to death, the sound of this man laughing and talking to us and we prayed for it again. Don't you hear our voice a little in the corridor of your memory, don't our memories bloom in the sky above the mind? aaaaaaa God, God, you don't have mercy, mother, sleep even after hearing her cries. Come friend, come on, buddy, will I bear you all the day you live on your shoulders?
