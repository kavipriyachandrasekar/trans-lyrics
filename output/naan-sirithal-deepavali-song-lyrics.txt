If I laugh Diwali hoi day here ekadesi If I laugh Diwali hoi day here ekadesi The garden of the twilight flower i drink, i am the kambarasam i drink If I laugh... If I laugh diwali hoi day here ekadesi..... {There is no setting in my world, i don't know what night and day are here}} (2) Everything that has come is going, even the moon is worn out. The wound is always the body itself is the truth i have seen here. Come on, time will pass If I laugh.. If I laugh Diwali hoi day here ekadesi The garden of the twilight flower i drink, i am the kambarasam i drink If I laugh diwali hoi day here ekadesi..... ......................................... {When did the sea and the tide sleep, and when did the wave cross the shore and lake}} (2) Whoever sees the veenas will sing music even if he plays the veena The work of the diamond shining in the sky with the veena of nano-veena in the rescue hand Time will go by. . . . If I laugh Diwali hoi day here ekadesi The garden of the twilight flower i drink, i am the kambarasam i drink If I laugh diwali hoi day here ekadesi.....
