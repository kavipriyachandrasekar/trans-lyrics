The language of the wind is the language of the sound, the language of the flower, the language of the flower, the language of the flower, the language of the manama, the language of the sea, the language of the sea, the language of the sea, the language of love, the language of the love, the language of the vizhiya, the magazine. If you understand the languages of nature, you don't need the languages of man, if you understand the languages of the heart, then man doesn't need language at all. The language of the wind is the sound, the music, the language of the flower is the color or the smell. When the wind blows there are no directions, when love speaks there are no languages, there are no silences like the words spoken. The word spoken by the eyes does not know god does not know, the wind that wanders cannot be shaped. If you understand the languages of nature, you don't need the languages of man, if you understand the languages of the heart, then man doesn't need language at all. The speech of the sky is released as a drop, the speech of the rainbow is released as color, the truth is the language of tears, if the woman is dumb, the shame is the language, the sound is the tongue of the fishes in the sounding jam, the speech of the desire is the language, and the movement of the heart of the desire is also the language. If you understand the languages of nature, you don't need the languages of man, if you understand the languages of the heart, then man doesn't need language at all. The language of the wind is the sound, the music, the language of the flower is the color or the smell.
