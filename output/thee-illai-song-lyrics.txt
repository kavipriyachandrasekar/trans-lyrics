Harris Jayaraj There is no fire, no smoke, no sacrifice, no thread in the eye, no loom, no love weaves in the mind No flower, no lobe, no new honey, i lose myself to you in life, yet i am no, i will put the symbol before and after the little one. Oho oho oho price i bought me oho oho oho oho ooho you got the dress oho oho oho coconut Oho ho ho oho ho oho ho oho ho oho ho oho ho ho I've been asking for a long time, you've been blindfolded and the crop has survived. Touch the ink on the side of the eye and write a will with the lips. Swallowing the fruit of literature The swallowed heart swelled It is not enough a witness eyes modhata love uratha There is no fire, no smoke, no sacrifice, no thread in the eye, no loom, no love weaves in the mind No flower, no lobe, no new honey, i lose myself to you in life, yet i am no, i will put the symbol before and after the little one. .......................................... Oho oh hmmmm Sitting on top of the funnel, the snow-smelling wind made a new song for us A herd of beach storks gathers in the village and sees the two come to the city A look at me as the touch swells to cool down the cross, the touch of the touch, the shoots are throbbing. Will you take me yourself and hide within you? There is no fire, no smoke, no sacrifice, no thread in the eye, no loom, no love weaves in the mind No flower, no lobe, no new honey, i lose myself to you in life, yet i am no, i will put the symbol before and after the little one. Oho oho oho price i bought me oho oho oho oho ooho you got the dress oho oho oho coconut
