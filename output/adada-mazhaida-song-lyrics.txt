Yuvan Shankar Raja ............................................. Adaadaa mazhadaa adaa mazhadaa azhaga siricha storm rain aadaadaa mazhadaa adaa mazhadaa azhaga siricha storm rain Alternately to rain, hold the umbrella in the mind, the legs are four, the hands are the hands, the hands are gone. When she dances in the rain like a peacock, my mind dances like a railway bridge. Adaadaa rainadaa adaa mazhadaa azhaga siricha storm raindaa ............................................. The song that doesn't sing is the rain, the song that doesn't sing, the song that doesn't sing, the song that you don't hear, put a salaam on the rain that has brought me to me, you don't see me a little, look within you. It's like magic, it's like a new trick, it's like a pambaram, i'm crazy in the middle of the temple. Where the angel is my angel is where it dances happily here There's no other one like you, what's the point of sending the little little kannu rendu to tell me something else? This eye is the one who has created the eye Butterfly girl heart throbbing ninnu poovum she is one of them kills me Where to go Where I go Where I am going, where the mind is swaying here in an inebriated state Adadaa mazhadaa ada mazhadaa azhaga siricha hot rainadaa adadaa mazhaidaa adaa mazhadaa azhaga sirichcha mazhaidaa adhaya maN^tha Binny Binny comes to the rain, lightning comes and catches the umbrella, the sky is divided, the earth is torn to pieces, and my breath is even hot. No one should hold out the umbrella and stop this rain, no one should control my mind.
