A. R. Rahman Ohooooooooooooo If you were with me I would be alive and I would be alive. If you are with me, I will be alive, and if you are with me, I will be alive. If you are with me, I will be alive, I will be alive, and if you are with me, I will be alive. Haaaaaaaaaaa true love whoever is true love i will tell you if you and I are lying, i will seek love and kill you The hair moustache will be placed together in the needle thread and stored in the chest like water in a coconut. The earth ball that bloomed on the stem of the flower is the only one I will live with hammers hammers and hammers I will wrap my mind around you and lie down in you like life in my body. If you were with me, I would be alive. If you were with me, I would be alive. If you were with me, I would be alive. Oh, if you're with me I'll be alive if you're with me aaa
