A. R. Rahman { Flowers, rest for a while, she has come, she has come} (2) Hey i if it's beautiful if that's beauty, hey i'm she, if it's god, if it's god, that's the particle of god she's the wonder if she's the honey, she's given a holiday to all those who wonder if she's come. Flowers, rest a little, she has come, she has come. There is no one in this world who is not waiting for you, in all the movements of the unthan i pass through the beauty of the eye and enter your heart and feel my ainbulan i Whoever extinguishes the fear and when she does to hug him, there is no doubt that in the tenderness of her eyes no world work is the slightest disease. Join my hands and sew my finger no longer and you keep our shadow She will do penance along the road to consume her petals Flowers, rest a little, she has come, she has come. Hey i if it's beautiful if that's beauty, hey i'm she, if it's god, if it's god, that's the particle of god she's the wonder if she's the honey, she's given a holiday to all those who wonder if she's come. I stood like a waterfall, I became a stream to swim on, like a mountain in the sky, I became a platform to dance to. She made me see who had seen me within me, and without asking, she cut off her heart and made a sculpture and gave it to me. The face is enough to see the yuga, this is enough for the heart to be a refuge. She gave life again, she made her stand up, and she came to smell all over the road of movement. Flowers, rest a little, she has come, she has come. Hey i if it's beautiful, if it's beautiful, she's the i of those eyes, if she's the leader, if it's the leader, she's given a holiday to all those eyes who wonder if he's you, you're awya haiyo, she's come. Flowers, rest a little, she has come, she has come.
