G.V. Prakash Kumar All the mind is drenched in rain, life Come and stay in my heart and beat me, my life is life. You stood in my eyes and snatched me away, my life is life. At night it came, the moon, my beauty came, your face came in the white or when you live and wear out, your beauty will not wear out. Is it the sun that shines during the day, my beauty, your two eyes are the weapon of fighting your eyelids. What are you doing to me? Rain is the mind, you are the flower of the flower o o o mana allam rain i am soaked in life You and I can be born as birds in the sky and forget the world. Ha, let's take turns in different spaces, let's fly, let's float, let's go hand in hand with the wind. Let's swing here and there in Mukilai Is it possible to live in a dream, is it magical to walk in front of me, the sights of the eye are tricks, where my body swims? It is possible to live in a dream, and my dream is sure to come true. I will hold your finger, and at this very moment your image will live in me forever. Rain ye maname you are the flower flower of the flower o o manaellam rainye soaked life If love dissolves, time will be forgotten and the weather will change. In the seven-colored rainbow, a hundred colours will appear, everything will be magic, the rain will come with the sun. Let's swing here and there in Mukilai The star does not come on the ground, but the eye does not see it, even if it is seen, the hand does not touch it. What happens to my mind if it touches it. Even if the star comes on the ground, the eye sees it, the hand touches it, and if you touch it, your mind becomes in love. Rain ye manam unnale poop pookkuthe o o o It's raining all over the mind
