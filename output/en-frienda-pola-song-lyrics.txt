................................ {Who is like my friend, who is like my friend, he has changed all the trends, he has changed all the trends, you have gone, you have gone to think about what our uncle has thought of, our heart is full of friendship, our heart is full of tears in our eyes} (2) The friend's shoulders and the mother's lap and the umbilical cord that he had bloomed in the distance beyond the love, the friendship was the highest ten steps We got your friendship and that's why we learned everything, we went up stairs and stood like a cloud in the sky. Why did you take the new path yourself, why did you leave halfway, we became a child looking for a mother, and if you weren't, where would we go? Who is like my friend, who is like my friend, who has changed all the trends, you have gone, what are you thinking about our uncle, our friend, our heart is full of tears in our eyes, our son-in-law, our eyes are full of tears.
