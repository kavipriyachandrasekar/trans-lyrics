Pallankuzhi pada purila unna nambi varenene this wild fear is like a lamb in your back Pallankuzhi pada purila unna nambi varenene this wild fear is like a lamb in your back Where are you going to take me, where are you going to take you? Where are you going to take me, where are you going to take you? From where did you come from, you throw the fish over the sky and throw it on the sky. Where are you going to take me, where are you going to take you? I'm afraid of my eyes and my fear is beating all the dust and my heart is white. Where are you going to take me, where are you going to take you? O thou hast dragged the earth out of heaven into heaven, thou hast drawn thy foot into the rainbow with the thread of the mind. If the earth comes out of heaven, the sun is in the east again. Where are you going to take me, where are you going to take you? Where are you going to take me....oh... Where are you going to take me?
