Hey friend, don't get angry, don't push love away, don't go away with false anger, don't let the youth get caught up again. It will fly beyond the sky that carries even the earth where the wings grow in the chest that enjoys the cheeks in the eye. Hey friend, don't get angry, don't push love away, don't go away with false anger, don't let the youth get caught up again. Adam gave eve it came to say love it came to say love this adam gave to eve this adam came to say love it came to say love, it is not possible to live without love. Don't put electricity in life, burn it with fire, make a man a woman and laugh, this love marriage will fail. Don't blame love for the mistake of lovers, if only love comes to your heart you will fly on top of this soil. If you eat the poison of love, there is no medicine to protect you, if you eat the poison of love there is no medicine to protect you, there is no pain like love. Know yesterday is not today, understand tomorrow you will rule, love is not poison, know, know that there is friendship within this love. Don't live in fantasy, don't make love an epic, don't quench your thirst in the mirage, don't just believe in love.
