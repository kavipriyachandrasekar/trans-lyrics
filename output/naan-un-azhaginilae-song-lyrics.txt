A. R. Rahman I feel god in your beauty I feel myself in your beauty Because the mind has gone and seen you, because you have seen the color of your heart. I feel god in your beauty I feel myself in your beauty What penances have I done to reach you to join me Let's see the world where the heart walks together, let's set our feet in the space of time in the light of love. No one has ever seen the love I've felt because you've felt the same thing. I feel god in your beauty I feel myself in your beauty The sky is the dream earth dream you and I are real. Lies dissolve, truth expands, all things disappear, or the universe dissolves for you to drink? The whole world is made of insignificant, your shame is sindhiye relationship, because I live in it. I feel god in your beauty I feel myself in your beauty Because your mind went beyond your face and saw you, because you saw the color of your heart. I feel god in your beauty I feel myself in your beauty Because the mind has gone and seen you, because you have seen the color of your heart. I feel godly in your beauty
