Smile... It falls on the drops of light... Dreams dreams, dreams, subconscious dreams come true..... This is the lines of poetry written by God or this is the lines of poetry written by God. The rain is playing with me as soft music, as meek music... The rain is playing with me with humans, birds, animals The rain of the feet will fall on the ground, the rain will fall on the ground for us, the rain will fall on the ground, the rain will splash on the ground for us, the sky itself will be many pieces, it will fall on the ground and celebrate us. Smile... Dreams, dreams, dreams come true, dreams fall on the drops of light. This is the lines of poetry written by God or this is the lines of poetry written by God. The rain is playing with me as soft music, as meek music... The rain is playing with me with humans, birds, animals Oh... Oh. Oh...........oh....oh.. Oh.....oh.......oh... The rain of the gana, the seven swaras, the rain of love, the rain of love, the one hundred swaras, your little thimiro nadaswaram, if you mix with me, you are the living swaram. Without forgetting, I will say thank you and tie the garland with a drop of rain The smile falls on the drops of light, the dreams, the dreams, the dreams of the subconscious mind, the dreams of the subconscious. This is the lines of poetry written by God or this is the lines of poetry written by God. The rain is playing with me as soft music, as meek music... The rain is playing with me with humans, birds, animals The rain of the feet will fall on the ground, the rain will fall on the ground for us, the rain will fall on the ground, the rain will splash on the ground for us, the sky itself will be many pieces, it will fall on the ground and celebrate us.
