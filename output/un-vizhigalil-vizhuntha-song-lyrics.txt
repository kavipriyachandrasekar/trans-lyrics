Anirudh Ravichander I was lost in the days that fell into your eyes, that's enough, girl. In the days I dissolved and that's enough, i don't want anything, girl. The beloved who came in my dream, you came into the waking up of your eyes, I searched for her, I searched for her, I found my angel, i gave you what i gave you in its entirety, i bought you. If you laugh every day, you don't want anything else, I want nothing else, I want nothing more than I want to live. I heard the sound of you speaking in the direction of the wind, and I will turn into the wind, my dear. If you touch the finger of your hand, my nights will be prolonged and I will not like the day any more because of you, dear, dear, love, this beautiful love is real because of love. If you laugh every day, you don't want anything else, I want nothing else, I want nothing more than I want to live. : { I was lost in the days that fell into your eyes, and that is enough, girl, you don't want anything.
