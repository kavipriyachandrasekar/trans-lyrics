.......................................... Don't put a fuss until no one comes and rubs you, no one's going to you. If you don't be a, you're a fire, if there's a heat inside, there'll be light in your life. Don't put a fuss until no one comes and rubs you, no one's going to you. Take the worry cloth that the mind is wearing and untie it no longer. We have come here to cry with the tears that are there. Don't put a fuss until no one comes and rubs you, no one's going to you. If you try, at the same time, the back-bearing Himalaya will become like a river, even the deep sea will turn into a river. Oh..... Don't put a fuss until no one comes and rubs you, no one's going to you. If you don't be a, you're a fire, if there's a heat inside, there'll be light in your life. Don't put a fuss until no one comes and rubs you, no one's going to you.
